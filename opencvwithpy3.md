## Hacking Opencv 3.2 with python 3.5

OpenCV or open computer vision is not only a great library to learn about the basic of vision in general but it is also one of the most widely used libraries at the production level. In order to get it working on your machine (Linux assumed) you need to follow a set process which I have generalised into a standard bash script.

Hoever it is usually built with python 2.x support. With libraries like [darkflow](https://github.com/thtrieu/darkflow) requiring python 3 support with opencv you have the simplest option as:
